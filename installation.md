# 🚀 Installation

First off — **I'm sorry you're seeing this!**  
You probably ran into an issue during setup, and this page is here to get you back on track.  
You weren’t supposed to land here, but no worries — I’ll guide you through it step by step.

---

### ✅ 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and authenticated.

To check if it’s available:

```bash
which gcloud
```

If that prints a valid path (like `/Users/you/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud`), you're good to go ✅

---

### 📦 2. Install the Workflow

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/dineshgowda24/alfred-gcp-workflow/releases).
2. Double-click the `.alfredworkflow` file — it will open in Alfred and install the workflow.
3. Open Alfred and type `gcp`. For the **first and only time**, you’ll be prompted to complete a quick setup.

### ⚙️ 3. Set the `gcloud` Binary Path

When prompted:

- Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to select the `gcloud-path` setup option  
  ![Step 1](images/docs/install_step1.png)

- Alfred will then ask you to enter the path to your `gcloud` binary  
  ![Step 2](images/docs/install_step2.png)

To find your path, run:

```bash
which gcloud
```

Copy the result and paste it into Alfred. If it's correct, you’ll see a ✅ success message.

### 🎉 4. You’re All Set!

Now just hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Tab</kbd> again to go to the home screen of the workflow.

From here, you can explore services, search resources, or manage configurations — all with Alfred's lightning-fast speed.
